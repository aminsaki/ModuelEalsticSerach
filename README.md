     public function serach()
       {
           $result=ElasticClient::create();
           $re=$result->search('index', 'title', 'test');
           $r=$result->resultHit($re);
           return $r;
       } 
     ...

       {
           $result=ElasticClient::create();
           $re=$result->delete('index', 'my_id48848' );
           $r=$result->resultHit($re);
           return $r;
        } 
     ...
     
 # bulk 
 
 This method is for doing several operations together

     public function bulk()
        {

            $re=$result->bulk('index', ['title'=>'test','body'=>'this is one test'] ,'index');
            $r=$result->resultHit($re);
            return $r;
         }

               $re=$result->reindex('index', 'index2');
             $r=$result->resultHit($re);
